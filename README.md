# MintAndStake

Please note this project was used as a personal learning exercise. 
There is a mix of styles and methods being used to develop the project and was never inteded for real world use
hence the lack of testing and abundance of bugs

The purpose of this application is to allow minting, and staking of ERC721 tokens where an ERC20 token would then be minted and transfered to the stakers.
This project has taught me the basic of blockchain development and interactions using a javascript library. 

# STACK:

React jS
Vite
Bootstrap
React router
Ethers.js
WGMI react hooks
Solidity
Avalanche (AVAX)
